## LPSD final exam

#### Question 1:
	a) Design an 8x8 array multiplier using VHDL/Verilog
	b) Synthesis your design using your desirable synthesis tool using 45nm
	   technology.
	c) Report occupation area, power consumption, and delay of the design.
	d) Apply the pipelining technique to your design to reduce the power
	consumption and report the amount of power saving you have gained.
#### Question 2:
	a) Design the 8x8 array multiplier in HSpice using 45nm technology (you can
	   use Predictive Transistor Model: [http://ptm.asu.edu/](http://ptm.asu.edu/) ) and report the
           power consumption and the delay of your design.
	b) Apply Dual-Vth technique to your design and report the power consumption
	   and the delay. Please explain your observations and results in detail.
