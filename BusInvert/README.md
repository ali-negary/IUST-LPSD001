## Assignment 2 - Simulation of Bus Invert

Assignment NO.2 is implemented using Python.

The program is a simulator that performs all the reqeuested requirements in consecutive order. The result of the program provides a detailed report of all the steps.

There are two version of the program. The difference is in the way each program chooses the optimal partition size to calculate the transitions.
The `Primitive` version simply chooses the minimum value. On the other hand, the `Smarter` version considers the overhead that is added to the array sizes.

To run the files you only need to have Python3 and enter the following commnad in the terminal (command is for Linux):

```python3 smarter_approach.py```
